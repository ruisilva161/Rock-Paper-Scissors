# Rock-Paper-Scissors
A simple implementation of grade-school classic “rock paper scissors” using JavaScript

This project is part of "The Odin Project" Foundations course.
Here I am going to make a simple implementation of grade-school classic “rock paper scissors”. Initially we’re just going to play the game from the browser console, but will revisit this project in a later lesson and add a Graphical User Interface with buttons and text.
